The goal for this course will be to understandand the origin of the chemical elements and their abundances. 
We will cover 14 Billion years, from the first instance of nucleosynthesis shorty after the Big Bang, to 



### Evaluation and course requirements 




The setup of this class is as follows: in the lectures, it is assumed that you worked through the corresponding chapter of the day (see table below) beforehand. During the lecture, we will discuss the most relevant topics of the lectures, and the most relevant questions you have about this. You need to email your questions before Wednesday 13:00 to Vsevolod Nedora and David Ramon Aguilera Dena (vnedora@astro.uni-bonn.de> and davidrad@astro.uni-bonn.de) so that they can be considered for the lectures. In your email, please use "NucSyn" as subject, and mention at the beginning of your question the corresponding subsection of the lecture notes. Note that 50% of the grade for this lecture will be based on your questions. The other half will be based on your presentation. Your presence in the lectures, and in the excercise class, is also a requirement to earn the credit points for this class.
