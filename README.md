### Bibliography 
The powerpoint presentations will be available in the table below. I will try my best to upload the slides at least two days before the Thursday lectures. 

The lectures will follow the material provided in the: 
* [Lecture notes by N. Langer](https://astro.uni-bonn.de/~nlanger/siu_web/nucscript/Nucleo.pdf)

These notes provide a brief and concise summary of the concepts covered in the following books:

Pagel, Nucleosynthesis and Chemical  Evolution of  Galaxies, 2009, Second edition, Cambridge University Press, ISBN 978-0-521-84030-9](https://books.google.de/books?id=5z4_nJMRZEwC&pg=PA444&dq=B.E.J.+Pagel,+Nucleosynthesis+and+Chemical++Evolution+of++Galaxies&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiLl7WX7ZXgAhWFDCwKHZAbCkcQ6wEIKTAA#v=onepage&q&f=false)
* [[CLAYTON] D.D. Clayton, Principles of Stellar Evolution and Nucleosynthesis, 1968, University of Chicago Press, ISBN 0-226 10953-4](https://books.google.de/books?id=8HSGFThnbvkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=D.D.+Clayton,+Principles+of+Stellar+Evolution+and+Nucleosynthesis&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjO2aj47JXgAhWNhaYKHcwbABYQ6wEIKTAA#v=onepage&q&f=false)

We will also discuss some topics from:

#### Evaluation and course requirements 
The setup of this class is as follows: in the lectures, it is assumed that you worked through the corresponding chapter of the day  beforehand (see schedule below). During the lecture, we will briefly cover the corresponding topic, and then discuss your questions. 

You need to email your (non-trivial) questions before Tuesday 13:00 to the tutors so that they can be considered for the lectures. 
In your email, please include "NucSyn" in the subject, and mention at the beginning of your question the corresponding subsection of the lecture notes (or book page).

The final grade will be calculated as follows: 
* 25% -- attendance in lectures and excercise classes
* 25% -- questions 
* 50% -- paper presentations 

Your presence in the lectures, and in the excercise class, is also a requirement to earn the credit points for this class. 

#### Paper presentations 
Each student is expected to give a 15 min presentation (10' + 5' for questions) on a recent research paper on a topic in nucleosynthesis. Please e-mail your preference to janton [at] mpifr.de by May 24. A list of suggested papers is available [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#user/libraries/srWK-pAGTZ-D1fpyllBK3g). Please check the library description to see if a paper has already been chosen. Note that you will need an active account to view the library. 
If you don't already have an account, you can register [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/user/account/register)
