### Bibliography 
The powerpoint presentations discussed in the class are available in the table below. I will try my best to upload the slides at least two days before the Thursday lectures. You can also fork the entire github rep by following the [View on Github] button above. 

The lectures will follow the material provided in the: 
* [Lecture notes by N. Langer](https://astro.uni-bonn.de/~nlanger/siu_web/nucscript/Nucleo.pdf)

These notes provide a brief and concice summary of the concepts covered in the following books:

Pagel, Nucleosynthesis and Chemical  Evolution of  Galaxies, 2009, Second edition, Cambridge University Press, ISBN 978-0-521-84030-9](https://books.google.de/books?id=5z4_nJMRZEwC&pg=PA444&dq=B.E.J.+Pagel,+Nucleosynthesis+and+Chemical++Evolution+of++Galaxies&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiLl7WX7ZXgAhWFDCwKHZAbCkcQ6wEIKTAA#v=onepage&q&f=false)
* [[CLAYTON] D.D.

We will also discuss some topics from:

#### Evaluation and course requirements 
The setup of this class is as follows: in the lectures, it is assumed that you worked through the corresponding chapter of the day (see table below) beforehand. During the lecture, we will discuss the most relevant topics of the lectures, and the most relevant questions you have about this. 

You need to email your questions before Wednesday 13:00 to the tutors  so that they can be considered for the lectures. 
In your email, please use "NucSyn" as subject, and mention at the beginning of your question the corresponding subsection of the lecture notes.

The final grade will be calculated as follows: 
* 25% -- questions and attendance in lectures and excercise class
* 25% -- exercises 
* 50% -- paper presentations 

Your presence in the lectures, and in the excercise class, is also a requirement to earn the credit points for this class. 

#### Paper presentations 
Each student is expected to give a presentation of 15 minutes (10' + 5' for questions) to discuss a recent research paper on a topic in nucleosynthesis. Please send the details of the paper you would like to present to janton [at] mpifr.de by May 20. A list of suggested papers is available [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#user/libraries/srWK-pAGTZ-D1fpyllBK3g). Please check the library description to see if a paper has already been chosen
