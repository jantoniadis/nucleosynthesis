### Nucleosynthesis: Course overview 

Welcome to astro858, a course on nucleosynthesis! 

### Goal 
 * To undestand the Universe's chemical composition, and its evolution in time and space

### !!!!!COVID-19 UDATE!!!!!
Due to the current situation and until further notice __the course will be taught online__ using the ecampus platform (see below)
More specifically, each lecture will consist of a series of videos, online quizzes and questions. 
These modules are __self-paced__, i.e. you can complete them at your own time, but not after the corresponding deadline (each module should take ~2-3 hours to complete).
The exercise classes will be replaced by weekly zoom meetings (TBA). 

Until we revert back to normal teaching, your credit will be calculated as follows: 
* 25% -- online quizzes
* 25% -- participation in zoom  
* 50% -- paper presentations (TBH online, if nothing changes) 


To join, please visit the [astro858 e-campus/basis page](https://ecampus.uni-bonn.de/goto_ecampus_crs_1662948.html) or use 
the following [link](https://ecampus.uni-bonn.de/goto.php?target=crs_1662948_rcode5m6ALEajcM&client_id=ecampus) (note that both links require a valid UNI-ID)

If you're interested in joining the course, put the above methods don't work, please send an email to janton@mpifr.de

#### Evaluation and course requirements 
The setup of this class is as follows: in the lectures, it is assumed that you worked through the corresponding chapter of the day  beforehand (see schedule below). During the lecture, we will briefly cover the corresponding topic, and then discuss your questions. 

You need to email your (non-trivial) questions before Tuesday 13:00 to the tutors so that they can be considered for the lectures. 
In your email, please include "NucSyn" in the subject, and mention at the beginning of your question the corresponding subsection of the lecture notes (or book page).

The final grade will be calculated as follows: 
* 30% -- excercises
* 20% -- questions 
* 50% -- paper presentations 

Your presence in the lectures, and in the excercise class, is also a requirement to earn the credit points for this class. 

#### Paper presentations 
Each student is expected to give a 15 min presentation (10' + 5' for questions) on a recent research paper on a topic in nucleosynthesis. Please e-mail your preference to janton [at] mpifr.de by May 24. A list of suggested papers is available [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#user/libraries/srWK-pAGTZ-D1fpyllBK3g). Please check the library description to see if a paper has already been chosen. Note that you will need an active account to view the library. 
If you don't already have an account, you can register [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/user/account/register)
